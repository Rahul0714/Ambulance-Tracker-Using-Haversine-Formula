the solution to the problem can be creating an Application where Patient can book an Ambulance from Patients nearby location, and when Ambulance will reach to Patient using the shortest possible distance, it will find a nearby Hospital by checking the availability of beds and required medical equipment, after finalizing the Hospital Ambulance will follow the shortest path to the Hospital. 
The Ambulances used to carry Covid-19 Patients are potential accessories for spreading Virus.  It is necessary to isolate these ambulances from other vehicles and pedestrians. For this problem, the solution can be sending the route information which is being followed by an ambulance to the traffic police through GPS.
